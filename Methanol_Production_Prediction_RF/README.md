# Methanol Production Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project is focused on building a predictive model to determine the optimal conditions for methanol production. 
It includes a dataset collected over a two-month period, a catalyst code mapping file to assist with data entry, and 
an experimental Random Forest machine learning model.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset: `methanol_production_dataset.csv`

This dataset contains operational parameters related to methanol production, collected over a **two-month period**. Due to the confidential nature of data in this industry, the dataset has been anonymized and curated for research purposes.

### âœ… Features:
- Flow Rate
- Carbon to Hydrogen Ratio
- CO%
- Hâ‚‚%
- COâ‚‚%
- CHâ‚„%
- Oâ‚‚%
- Nâ‚‚%
- Catalyst Type (encoded)
- Catalyst Tube Diameter

### ðŸŽ¯ Target:
- Methanol Production Rate

> **Note:** This dataset is limited in size and variety, and should not be used for real-world deployment without further validation.

## ðŸ§ª Catalyst Code Mapping: `catalyst_code_mapping.csv`

To simplify data entry and analysis for non-IT professionals, catalyst types are encoded using a human-readable mapping file.
